# Bioinformatics Contest 2021 - Scripts
This repository contains the scripts I (competitor "James Matthew Holt", 2nd place) used for the [Bioinformatics Contest 2021](https://bioinf.me/en/contest/2021).

## Some notes on the code status
1. Most (if not all) of the scripts are in their "final" state at the end of the competition, and haven't been modified since the end of the competition. 
2. Most scripts are in the condition used for the "hardest" problem in each set, and are potentially different from the version I used for earlier "simpler" problems. I believe they will theoretically work on these simpler problems, but I have not gone back to test them since the end of the contest. 
3. Each problem includes a README with a brief description of how I approached the problem, with details left in the code. If there are any questions about it, feel free to ask in the issues section.
4. While these scripts worked for the competition, many of them are undoubtedly _not_ the best way to solve the problem, they are simply _a_ way to solve the problem.
